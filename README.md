## Releasing

Since the release process is handled by ['semantic-release'](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/) you can just follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification and the release will be handled automatically. Please consult the references below for more understanding about how the `semantic-release` works:
